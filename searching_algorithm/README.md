# Searching Algorithms (Java)

This folder contains implementations of different **searching algorithms** written in **Java** as part of my **DSA 2026 preparation**.

## 📌 Algorithms Covered
- Binary Search


### 📌 Learning Sequence for Binary Search

1. **BinarySearchStart**  
   Learn the fundamental binary search template and core logic.

2. **floor_and_ceiling_binary_search**  
   Understand how to find the floor and ceiling of a target element.

3. **NextGreatestLetter**  
   Apply binary search on characters and handle wrap-around cases.

4. **FistandLastPosition**  
   Find the first and last occurrence of an element in a sorted array.

5. **infinityArray**  
   Learn how binary search works when the array size is unknown.

6. **peakIndexinMountainArray**  
   Identify the peak element in a mountain array using binary search.

7. **RotatedinSortedArray**  
   Search for an element in a rotated sorted array (without duplicates).

8. **rotatedArrayWithDuplicates**  
   Handle rotated sorted arrays that contain duplicate elements.

9. **countNumberinRotationArray**  
   Count how many times a sorted array has been rotated.

10. **splitArraywithDuplicates**  
    Use binary search on answers to split an array into valid subarrays.
